# Hi, I'm Brandon 👋



> Computer Science graduate passionate about systems, infrastructure, distributed software, and building performant systems to solve problems efficiently.

## Current Projects
  ---

- 🤠[RepoWrangler](https://github.com/BAMorgan/RepoWrangler) - Uses LLMs, Tree-sitter, and a TUI to explore codebases and generate models, diagrams, and reports.
- 🖼️[PixelPipe](https://github.com/BAMorgan/PixelPipe) - Flexible vision pipeline for turning images and video into reliable outputs.


I like working at the intersection of:

- ⚙️ Backend / Systems Engineering  
- ☁️ DevOps / Infrastructure / Observability  
- 🧠 Machine Learning / Computer Vision  
- 🔌 Low-level / Performance-oriented programming  

---

## 🚀 What I’m Focused On

I’m especially interested in:

- ML / CV systems & infrastructure
- Distributed architectures & data pipelines
- Infrastructure-as-code & self-hosting
- Developer tooling & internal platforms
- Performance, efficiency, and clean abstractions


Long-term, I’m working toward roles in:

**Systems Engineering · DevOps · Backend · ML Infrastructure · Embedded / Robotics Software**

---

## 🛠️ Tech I Work With

### Languages
- Java
- Go
- Python
- Rust

### Backend / Systems
- Spring Boot
- FastAPI
- REST / APIs
- Async & concurrent systems
- Distributed architectures

### Infrastructure / DevOps
- Kubernetes
- Docker / Docker Compose
- Proxmox
- Linux / Ubuntu
- Prometheus / Grafana
- Observability & telemetry
- Self-hosted services

### Data / ML / CV
- Data processing pipelines
- Synthetic data / augmentation workflows
- ML experimentation environments

## 🧪 Things I Like Building

I’m drawn to projects involving:

- Distributed systems  
- Infrastructure & homelab architecture    
- Data pipelines & telemetry systems  
- ML / CV experimentation systems  
- Performance-sensitive software   

---

## 🖥️ Homelab & Infra

I run a fairly involved self-hosted environment where I experiment with:

- Virtualization (Proxmox / VMs / containers)
- Containerized services
- Container orchestration 
- Monitoring & observability stacks
- Network design & service architecture
- Reliability & failure scenarios

This is where many of my ideas get prototyped before becoming full projects.

---

## 🧭 Engineering Interests

I care a lot about:

- System design & architecture
- Reliability & fault tolerance
- Developer experience
- Performance & efficiency
- Clean abstractions over complexity
- Understanding how things work *under the hood*

---

## 📈 Current Goals

- Deepen systems & distributed architecture skills
- Build production-style personal projects
- Expand DevOps / infra engineering expertise
- Continue exploring Computer Vision systems
- Move toward highly technical engineering roles
