# Hi, I'm Brandon 👋



> Computer Science graduate passionate about systems, infrastructure, distributed software, and building performant systems to solve problems efficiently.

I like working at the intersection of:

- ⚙️ Backend / Systems Engineering  
- 🧠 Machine Learning / Computer Vision  
- 🔌 Low-level / Performance-oriented programming 
- ☁️ DevOps / Infrastructure / Observability  
 


## Current Projects

- 🖼️[PixelPipe](https://github.com/BAMorgan/PixelPipe) - Flexible vision pipeline for turning images and video into reliable outputs.

## 🚀 What I’m Focused On

I’m especially interested in:

- ML / CV systems & infrastructure
- Distributed architectures & data pipelines
- Infrastructure-as-code & self-hosting
- Developer tooling & internal platforms
- Performance, efficiency, and clean abstractions


Long-term, I’m working toward roles in:

**Systems Engineering · DevOps · Backend · ML Infrastructure · Embedded / Robotics Software**

---

## 🛠️ Tech I Work With

### Languages
- Java
- Go
- Python
- Rust

### Backend / Systems
- Spring Boot
- FastAPI
- REST / APIs
- Async & concurrent systems
- Distributed architectures

### Infrastructure / DevOps
- Kubernetes
- Docker / Docker Compose
- Proxmox
- Linux / Ubuntu
- Prometheus / Grafana
- Observability & telemetry
- Self-hosted services

### Data / ML / CV
- Data processing pipelines
- Synthetic data / augmentation workflows
- ML experimentation environments

---

## 🖥️ Homelab & Infra

I run a fairly involved self-hosted environment where I experiment with:

- Virtualization (Proxmox / VMs / containers)
- Containerized services
- Container orchestration 
- Monitoring & observability stacks
- Network design & service architecture
- Reliability & failure scenarios

This is where many of my ideas get prototyped before becoming full projects.
